    C++ has the following conditional statements:

    Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
    Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
    Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
    Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
